      <h2>Top section</h2>
      <p>This is where you sell in 
      your new self. You're happy to combine your previous experience with your new 
      frontend skills or basically use this are to describe yourself the way you see 
      your role in the future. Either you do something like "Frontend + design" or 
      more of a sentence like; "Frontend developer with a background in communications".
      Or if you don't see yourself as a frontend developer in the future maybe you 
      want to write something like; "Project manager with coding skills". 
      It's your portfolio. Choose images so that they mirror who you are.</p>

    <section class="white" id="summary-section">
      <h2>Summary section</h2> 
        <p>is the section where you summarise what you have been doing in the 
      past and what you are wanting to do in the future. This gives the reader 
      an idea of who you are. Keep it short and personal.

    <section class="grey" id="tech-section">
      <h2>Summary section</h2>
        <p>Give a short summary/name dropping of all the technologies, tools, 
        libraries and things that you know and will know during this course. 
        It's really the more the merrier here.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section class="white" id="projects-section">
      <h2>Featured projects</h2>
        <p>Put the projects that you are most proud of here. 
          Make sure to mention all technologies, libraries or APIs 
          that you have used. Don't feel like you are repeating yourself. 
          As a recruiter looking for a React developer – the more React 
          is mentioned – the better. I you have other code projects that 
          are not related to this course, feel free to add them too. 
          Link your projects to their Github page.

        <p>This is the area where you really can present yourself and 
        your thoughts about code. It's extremely helpful for recruiters 
        to pick your brain a little and see that you don't just code 
        – you also reflect. 
        Put a link to your reflections for the industry assignment after 
        each sprint here or if you have ever written anything else on this topic.
        If you have only made LinkedIn posts as your reflection previously, 
        try and get a few words down after next sprint on either medium or 
        as an article on LinkedIn.
